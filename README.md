# Customer-Segmentation-RFM-Kmean
## Business Problem:

An e-commerce company is facing challenges in optimizing its marketing and customer retention strategies. While some customers appear highly engaged, others show signs of reduced activity or are at risk of disengagement. Currently, the company employs a one-size-fits-all approach to customer engagement, which results in inefficiencies in marketing spend and missed opportunities to maximize customer lifetime value.

To address this issue, the company aims to segment its customer base based on behavioral and transactional data (such as purchase frequency, recency of orders, and monetary value). By identifying distinct customer segments, the company intends to develop targeted marketing strategies that cater to the unique needs and behaviors of each group.
